# Valid Brackets

Write code to create a function that takes in a string and returns `true` if the string contains a valid set or sets of brackets, else `false` should be returned.

## Instructions

    - Return `true` if the string contains a valid set or sets of brackets, else return `false`.

    - For example, given the following string:

    ```js
    var str = "( )";
    ```

    - The following should be returned:

    ```js
    true;
    ```

    - If given the following string:

    ```js
    var str = "{ } [ ( [] ) ]";
    ```

    - The following should be returned:

    ```js
    true;
    ```

    - If given the following string:

    ```js
    var str = "( [ ) ]";
    ```

    - The following should be returned:

    ```js
    false;
    ```

    - Since the "[" and ")" are mismatched.
