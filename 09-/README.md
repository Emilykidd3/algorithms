# Missing Number

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes an unsorted array of positive and unique integers and returns the missing integer.

## Instructions

- write a function to achieve the following:

  - Return the number missing from the array.

  - For example, given the following array:

  ```js
  var arr = [3, 0, 1];
  ```

  - The following should be returned:

  ```js
  2;
  ```

  - Since `0`, `1`, and `3` are present, the number missing from the sequence is `2`.

  - Though the array is unsorted, a sequence will always start from `0`.

  - If no numbers are missing from the sequence, assume the missing number is the next highest number in the sequence. For example, given the following array:

  ```js
  var arr = [0];
  ```

  - The following should be returned:

  ```js
  1;
  ```

  - Given the an empty array:

  ```js
  var arr = [];
  ```

  - The following should be returned:

  ```js
  0;
  ```
