# Camel Case

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes a string and returns the string in camelCase.

## Instructions

- Return a camelCased version of the given string.

- A string is camelCased when there are no spaces between words, the first letters of each word except the first word is capitalized and all other letters are lowerCased.

- For example, given the following string:

```js
var str = "let the force flow through you";
```

- The following string should be returned:

```js
"letTheForceFlowThroughYou";
```
