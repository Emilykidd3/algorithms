# Reverse Words

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes a string and returns a new string with the order of the words reversed.

## Instructions

    - Return a new string that has all the words in the given string in reversed order. Reverse the order of the _words_, not the _letters_ in the string.

    - e.g. given the following string:

    ```js
    var str = "just keep swimming";
    ```

    - The following string should be returned:

    ```js
    "swimming keep just";
    ```
