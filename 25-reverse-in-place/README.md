# Reverse In Place

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes an array and reverses the array in place without using the built-in `reverse` method.

## Instructions

- Reverse the array in place without using the built-in `reverse` method.

- To reverse an array "in place" means to reverse the original array without creating a brand new array. This can be achieved by swapping elements within the original array.

- Return the array after it has been reversed.

- e.g. given the following array:

```js
var arr = [2, 4, 6, 8];
```

- The original `arr` array should be returned, but with it's elements in reverse order.

```js
[8, 6, 4, 2]; // this still refers to the original arr array
```

### Hints

- This is easier achieved with a [while-loop](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_while.asp), rather than a for-loop.

- Think about where each element in an array is moved to when an array is reversed.
