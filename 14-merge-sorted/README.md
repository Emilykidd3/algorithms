# Merge Sorted

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes in two sorted arrays of numbers and merges the contents of both arrays into one new sorted array. **You may not use the built in sort method for this activity.**

## Instructions

    * Return a new sorted array containing the contents of `arr1` and `arr2`.

    * For example, given the following arrays:

    ```js
    var arr1 = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42];
    var arr2 = [1, 2, 3, 6, 20, 21];
    ```

    * The following should be returned:

    ```js
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 15, 16, 20, 21, 23, 42];
    ```

    * Given the following arrays:

    ```js
    var arr1 = [13, 15, 31, 99];
    var arr2 = [100];
    ```

    * The following should be returned:

    ```js
    [13, 15, 31, 99, 100];
    ```

    * **You may not use the built in sort method for this activity.**
