# Double Triple Map

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a transformed array where even numbers are doubled and odd numbers are tripled.

## Instructions

Return a new array derived from the original array. Each element in the new array should correspond each element in the original array. The element at each index of the new array should be double the original element if it is even, else triple the original if it is odd.

* For example, given the following array:

```js
var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
```

* The following array should be returned:

```js
[3, 4, 9, 8]
```
