# Squares of a Sorted Array

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes an array of integers sorted in ascending (increasing) order and returns a new array containing the squares of each number in ascending order.

## Instructions

    * Return a new array containing the squares of each number in the first array in sorted order.

    * For example, given the following array:

    ```js
    var arr = [-4, -1, 0, 3, 10];
    ```

    * The following array should be returned:

    ```js
    [0, 1, 9, 16, 100];
    ```

    * Given the following array:

     ```js
    var arr = [-7, -3, 2, 3, 11];
    ```

    * The following array should be returned:

    ```js
    [4, 9, 9, 49, 121];
    ```

    * Notice how squaring a number may change its order in the new array. ie `-7` is less than `2`, but `-7` squared is greater than `2` squared.
