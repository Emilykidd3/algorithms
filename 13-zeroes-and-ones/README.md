# Zeroes and Ones

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes in a string containing only 0s and 1s, and returning true if there are an equal number of 0s and 1s, else returning false.

## Instructions

    * Return true if there are an equal number of 0s and 1s in the given string.

    * For example, given the following string:

    ```js
    var str = "00110011"; // 4 0s, 4 1s
    ```

    * The following should be returned:

    ```js
    true
    ```

    * Given the following string:

    ```js
    var str = "11110"; // 4 1s, 1 0
    ```

    * The following should be returned:

    ```js
    false
    ```
