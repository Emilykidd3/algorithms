# Look And Say Sequence

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes a number and returns a new number that satisfies the [look-and-say-sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence).

## Instructions

- Return a new number that [look-and-say-sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence) for the given number.

- The look and say sequence can be understood by reading a number out loud, digit by digit, but first saying the number of times each digit appears in a row.

- For example, given the following number:

```js
var n = 5442;
```

- There is **one** five, **two** fours, and **one** two. So the look-say-sequence of `n` should be `152412`.
