# Linear Search

Write a code to create a function that takes an array of numbers and a target number and returns the index of the target number in the given array.

## Instructions

- Return the index of the given `target` number in the given `arr` array.

- If the `target` number is not present in the given `arr` array, return -1.

- For example, given the following array and target number:

```js
var arr = [82, 22, -4, 21, 1, 8];
var target = 8;
```

- The following number should be returned:

```js
5;
```

- If the array contains multiple instances of the target number, return the index for the first instance.

- **You may not use the built-in `indexOf`, `lastIndexOf`, or `includes` methods for this problem.**
