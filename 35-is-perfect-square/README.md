# Is Perfect Square

write a code to create a function that takes in a whole number, and returns `true` if the number is a [perfect square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number), otherwise returns `false`.

## Instructions

  * If `num` is a [perfect square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number), return `true`. Else return `false`.

    * A perfect square is a number that has a whole number as a square root.

  * For example, given the following number:

  ```js
  var num = 36; // Square root of 36 is 6
  ```

  * The following number should be returned:

  ```js
  true
  ```

  * Given the following number:

  ```js
  var num = 50; // Square root of 50 is 7.07106781187
  ```

  * The following number should be returned:

  ```js
  false
  ```

  * **Complete this problem without the use of the built-in `Math.sqrt` method.**


### Hints

* If you aren't allowed to check the square root of the given number, maybe you can check if the [square of a number](http://www.math.com/school/subject1/lessons/S1U1L9GL.html) is the given number?
