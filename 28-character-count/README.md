# Character Count

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes a string and returns an object containing the characters in the string and the number of times they appear.

## Instructions

    - Create a new object.

    - Loop through each character in the given string and create a new key for each character in the string.

    - The value of the character's key should be the number of times it appears in the string.

    - For example, given the following string:

    ```js
    var str = "Hello World!";
    ```

    - The following object should be returned:

    ```js
    { H: 1, e: 1, l: 3, o: 2, ' ': 1, W: 1, r: 1, d: 1, '!': 1 }
    ```

### Hints

- You will need to use [object bracket notation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_accessors) to achieve this.
