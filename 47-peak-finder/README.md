# Peak Finder

Writing a code to create a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the peak of the array.

## Instructions

    - Return the peak of the array. A peak is defined as the element in the array that is greater than all of the numbers to its right and greater than all of the elements to its left.

    - For example, given the following array:

    ```js
    var arr = [1, 3, 7, 4, 3, 2, 1];
    ```

    - The following should be returned:

    ```js
    7;
    ```

    - Assume that the array contains exactly one peak.

    - It's possible for the peak to be the first or last element in the array if it is greater than all other elements. For example, the following given the following array:

    ```js
    var arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];
    ```

    - The following number should be returned:

    ```js
    10;
    ```

    - Assume the array will contain at least one number. If the array contains only one number, the only number is the peak.

### Bonus

- Can you implement this algorithm without checking every number in the array?
