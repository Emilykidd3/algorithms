// Write code to create a function that accepts a non-negative integer and returns the square root of the integer. If the square root is a decimal number, round down to the nearest whole integer
// You may not use the built-in `Math.sqrt` method

// pseudocode
// loop through numbers starting at 1
// if loop squared is less than x keep looping
// if loop squared is greater than x return i-1

var sqrt = function (x) { };
