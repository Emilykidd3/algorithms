# Square Root

Write a code to create a function that takes a positive integer and returns its square root.

## Instructions

  * Return the square root of the passed in integer. If the square root is a decimal number, round it down to a whole integer before returning it.

  * For example, given the following number:

  ```js
  var num = 25;
  ```

  * The following number should be returned:

  ```js
  5;
  ```

  * Given the following number:

    ```js
  var num = 6;
  ```

  * The following number should be returned:

  ```js
  2;
  ```

  * Since the square root of `6` is â‰ˆ`2.45`, we round it down to `2`.

  * You may not use the built-in `Math.sqrt` method.
