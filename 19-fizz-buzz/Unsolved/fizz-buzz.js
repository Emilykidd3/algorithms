// Write code to loop through the array of numbers
// At each iteration, if a number is evenly divisible by 3 print "Fizz"
// If a number is evenly divisible by 5 print "Buzz"
// If a number is evenly divisible by both 3 AND 5, print "Fizz Buzz"
// If a number is not divisible by 3 or 5, print the number

// loop through given arr
// if number is divisible by 3 & 5 print fizz buzz
// if number is divisible by 3 print fizz
// if number is divisible by 5 print buzz
// if else print number
