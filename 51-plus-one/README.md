# Plus One

Writing a code to create a function that takes in an array of digits representing a non negative integer and add one to it. The digits are arranged such that the most significant digits are on the left and each element in the array contains a single integer digit.

## Instructions

    - Add one to the digits array, modify and return the original array.

    - Do not use any Array methods such as `.join` or `.split`.

    - For example, if given the following array:

    ```js
    var digits = [1, 2, 3];
    ```

    - The following should be returned:

    ```js
    [1, 2, 4];
    ```

    - Given the following array:

    ```js
    var digits = [9];
    ```

    - The following should be returned:

    ```js
    [1, 0];
    ```

### Hints

- How will you handle the case where a digit overflows, ie becomes more than 9?
