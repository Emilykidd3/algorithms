// make a for loop that loops through the given array
// make another for loop withing that loop that compares the number from the first for loop to each of the other(or all) numbers in the array
// if the first loop number times the second loop number equals 20, return true
// if it doesnt, continue the second loop 
// if none of the numbers multiply to twenty the first for loop will go to the next number
// loop through all the numbers in the first loop
// if any multiply to equal 20, return true
// in none multiply to equal 20, return false
