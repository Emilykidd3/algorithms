# Min Increment For Unique

Write a code to create a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the minimum number of increments needed to make the numbers unique.

## Instructions

    - Return the minimum number of increments needed to make the numbers unique.

    - For example, given the following string:

    ```js
    var arr = [1, 2, 2];
    ```

    - The following should be returned:

    ```js
    1;
    ```

    - Since the array could be made to be unique by incrementing one of the number `2`s by `1`.

    - If given the following array:

    ```js
    var arr = [3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 7];
    ```

    - The following should be returned:

    ```js
    6;
    ```

    - Since one of the number `2`s could be incremented twice to make `4` and one of the number `1`s could be incremented four times to make `5`. Together this is `6` increments total.
