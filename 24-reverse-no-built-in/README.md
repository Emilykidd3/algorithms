# Reverse Words

In this activity you will be writing code to create a function that takes a string and returns a new string with all of the characters in reverse order. You are not allowed to use the built-in `reverse` method.

## Instructions

- Open [Unsolved/reverse-no-built-in.js](Unsolved/

  - Return a new string that has all the characters in the given string in reversed order.

  - e.g. given the following string:

  ```js
  var str = "just keep swimming";
  ```

  - The following string should be returned:

  ```js
  "gnimmiws peek tsuj";
  ```
