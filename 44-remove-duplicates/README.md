# Remove Duplicates

Writing a code to create a function that takes a sorted array of integers and then modifies the array to remove any duplicates.

## Instructions

- In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `removeDuplicates` function to achieve the following:

  - Remove duplicates from the original array so that each number present appears only once.

  - For example, given the following array:

  ```js
  var arr = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 9, 9];
  ```

  - The array should be updated to the following:

  ```js
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 9];
  ```

  - Do not create a new array, instead modify the provided array.

  - There is no need to return anything from this function.

### Hint

- How can you use the fact that the array is sorted to help solve this problem?
