// Write a function that takes in two sorted arrays and returns a pair of numbers (one from each array) with the smallest difference

// pseudocode
// set variable to return arr
// set var to smallest difference set as absolute value of arr1 of 1 minus arr2 of 2
// loop through first arr
// loop through second arr
// sub arr1 from arr2 and get absolute value
// if it is smaller than the var, replace var and use i and j as the new arr to return
// return arr

var smallestDifference = function (arr1, arr2) { };
