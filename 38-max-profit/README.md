# Max Profit

write a code to create a function that takes in an array of numbers each representing the price of a stock on a different day. Return the maximum profit that can be made from a single purchase of stock on one day and a single sale on a later day. 

## Instructions

  * Return an integer representing the maximum profit that can be made off a single purchase and sale of stock.

  * For example, given the following array:

  ```js
  var arr = [1, 6, 7, 9];
  ```

  * The following should be returned:

  ```js
  8;
  ```

  * Since buying when the stock is `1` and selling when the stock is `9` yields `8`.

  * Given the following array:

  ```js
  var arr = [9, 7, 4, 1];
  ```

  * The following should be returned:

  ```js
  0;
  ```

  * Since the stock decreases every day, there is no possible profit to be made.

  * Assume the array will only contain non-negative integers.
